It's painfully obvious seeing a colleague not knowing how to do research on their own.

If you haven't practice research on your own before, research looks like magic to you, don't be afraid to jump in and do the work!

If you've done that already, remember to spread the knowledge, show how!

Researching on your own is the number everyone has to learn, leading to autonomy of actions and ease of mind.
