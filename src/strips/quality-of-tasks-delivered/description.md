This is a tool/idea on checking in your work time.
The more tasks you are working on, the less time you have available to work on each task, affecting the quality of your work.

A suggested exercise is to do a weekly check-in on where is your current position in the chart,
and where was you position the previous week. This way you can see where you are trending to.
